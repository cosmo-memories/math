A ___basis___ of a [vector space]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/vecspace.html) $$\pmb {V}$$ is a __minimal spanning set__ for $$\pmb {V}$$. In other words, it is a set of linearly independent vectors that span $$\pmb {V}$$; any vector in $$\pmb {V}$$ may be written as a __linear combination of basis vectors__.

If $$\pmb {V}$$ has a basis with a finite number of elements, we call $$\pmb {V}$$ ___finite dimensional___. Furthermore, if $$\pmb {V}$$ is finite dimensional, then __every basis for $$\pmb {V}$$ has the same cardinality__, and we call that cardinality the ___dimension___ of $$\pmb {V}$$.
