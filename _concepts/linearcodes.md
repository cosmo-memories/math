A ___linear code $$\pmb {C}$$___ over $$\pmb {GF(q)}$$ consists of vectors which form a __subspace of [$$\pmb {V(n, q)}$$]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/vecspace.html)__.

Linear codes are commonly discussed in terms of their paramaters:

* $$\pmb {n}$$: the __length__ of $$\pmb {C}$$, that is, the number of symbols in a codeword.

* $$\pmb {k}$$: the __dimension__ of $$\pmb {C}$$; see [vector spaces]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/vecspace.html).

* $$\pmb {d}$$: the __distance__ of $$\pmb {C}$$, which for linear codes is equal to the minimum weight of all non-zero codewords.

A linear code with the above parameters is called an ___$$\pmb {[n, k, d]}$$-code___ or ___$$\pmb {[n, k, d]_q}$$-code___.

The ___size___ of $$\pmb {C}$$ refers to the number of codewords, and is equal to $$\pmb {q^k}$$.

It is common to represent a linear code in the form of a ___generator matrix___.

## Generator Matrix

A ___generator matrix $$\pmb {G}$$___ for a linear code $$\pmb {C}$$ is a matrix whose __rows are a basis for $$\pmb {C}$$__; in other words, the code is the row span of the matrix.

Therefore, $$\pmb {\vec v \in C \iff \vec v \text{ is a linear combination of rows of }G}$$.

$$\pmb {G}$$ is a $$\pmb {k \times n}$$ matrix with $$\pmb {k}$$ rows and $$\pmb {n}$$ columns.

All codewords $$\pmb {\vec c \in C}$$ may be generated by multiplying a message $$\pmb {\vec v \in GF(q)}$$ with the generator matrix. Distinct messages encode to distinct codewords for all $$\pmb {\vec v}$$.

There may be many different generator matrices for a given $$\pmb {C}$$. Applying the following elementary row operations to $$\pmb {G}$$ will result in another valid generator matrix for the same code:

* Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar.

* Swapping the position of two rows.

* Adding a row to another row.

This is due to the fact that row operations preserve linear independence. The new rows are merely linear combinations of the original rows. This also means that a generator matrix can be produced which is in ___reduced row echelon form__ [link forthcoming]_.
