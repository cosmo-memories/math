Let $$\pmb {\vec u = (u_1, u_2, . . . , u_n)}$$ and $$\pmb {\vec v = (v_1, v_2, . . . , v_n)}$$ be two vectors.

The ___dot product___ is a __scalar__ defined by:

$$\pmb {\vec u \cdot \vec v = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + . . . + u_n v_n}$$

$$\pmb {\vec u}$$ and $$\pmb {\vec v}$$ are ___orthogonal___ if their dot product is $$\pmb {0}$$.
