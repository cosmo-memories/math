___Block designs___ are an abstract mathematical structure consisting of two elements, denoted by $$\pmb{(X, B)}$$. $$\pmb{X}$$ refers to a __set of points__, while $$\pmb{B}$$ is a __collection of subsets of $$\pmb{X}$$__, known as __blocks__. Most commonly discussed and studied are __balanced incomplete block designs__, the parameters of which are detailed below.

## Balanced Incomplete Block Designs

Let $$\pmb{t}$$, $$\pmb{v}$$, $$\pmb{k}$$, $$\pmb{\lambda}$$, and $$\pmb{b}$$ be integers. Additionally, let $$\pmb{t < k < v}$$ and $$\pmb{\lambda \geq 1}$$.

We define a __$$\pmb{t-(v, k, \lambda)}$$ design__ as a pair $$\pmb{(X, B)}$$ with the following parameters:

* $$\pmb{v}$$ is the number of points contained in $$\pmb{X}$$.

* $$\pmb{k}$$ is the number of points per block in $$\pmb{B}$$.

* $$\pmb{b}$$ is the number of blocks in $$\pmb{B}$$.

* Any $$\pmb{t}$$ points are contained in exactly $$\pmb{\lambda}$$ blocks.

It is true in general that 

$$\pmb{b = \lambda \binom{v}{t} / \binom{k}{t}}$$

## Steiner Triple Systems

$$\pmb{2-(v, 3, 1)}$$ systems are known as ___Steiner triple systems of order $$\pmb{v}$$___, and are often denoted by the abbreviation $$\pmb{STS(v)}$$. These systems are comprised of __three-element blocks__ such that __no two elements appear in the same block more than once__.
