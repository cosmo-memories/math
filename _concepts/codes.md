## Alphabets
A ___$$\pmb {q}$$-ary_ alphabet__ is a set of $$\pmb {q}$$ distinct symbols. For example, $$\pmb {\{0, 1\}}$$ is a __$$\pmb {2}$$-ary__ alphabet with two symbols, $$\pmb {0}$$ and $$\pmb {1}$$, and is commonly called __binary__. A ___word___ is a finite sequence of symbols from some alphabet.

## Codes

A ___$$\pmb {q}$$-ary code___, usually denoted by $$\pmb {C}$$, is a (non-empty) set of words over a $$\pmb {q}$$-ary alphabet. The words in the set $$\pmb {C}$$ are called ___codewords___. If all codewords in $$\pmb {C}$$ have the same length (number of characters) $$\pmb {n}$$, then $$\pmb {C}$$ is a ___block code___ of ___length $$\pmb {n}$$___.

### Linear Codes

A ___[linear code]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/linearcodes.html) $$\pmb {C}$$___ over $$\pmb {GF(q)}$$ consists of vectors which form a __subspace of [$$\pmb {V(n, q)}$$]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/vecspace.html)__.
