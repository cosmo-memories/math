Named after [Thomas Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes), __Bayes' Theorem__ determines the likelihood of occurence of an event $$\pmb {A}$$, given the occurence of another event $$\pmb {B}$$. This is denoted by $$\pmb {P(A \vert B)}$$, which reads as "__the probability of $$\pmb {A}$$ given $$\pmb {B}$$__".

$$\pmb {P(A)}$$ and $$\pmb {P(B)}$$ are the probabilities of $$\pmb {A}$$ and $$\pmb {B}$$ occuring without any specific conditions.

$$\pmb { P(A \vert B) = { {P(B \vert A)P(A)} \over P(B) } }$$
