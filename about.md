Don't look at me. I'm getting there. Give me time.

This is a place for me to store math notes and references for my own use. You can look at it too if you like. 

Built using Jekyll, hosted on Github Pages, equations displayed using [MathJax](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference/27910).
