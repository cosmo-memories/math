<hr id="post-mid">

Hello and welcome to __Daguerreo__, my archive of mathematics notes from my university study. "[Daguerreotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype)" refers to an early photography process from the 1800s, which would be a pretty cool thing to name a website after -- however, this site is actually named after a location from the video game _Final Fantasy IX_. My name is David; you can find out more about me by visiting my personal website via the "Home" link above.

My intent is for this site to eventually serve as a full archive of everything I learned during my studies. However, rewriting and uploading years worth of material is a slow process and is currently not my highest priority, so expect updates to be sporadic and some categories to be empty for a while yet.

Daguerreo was built using Jekyll and is hosted (for now) on Github Pages. Equations and another mathematical text are displayed using [MathJax](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference/27910). The site's current barebones layout is temporary, and will be replaced with something shinier when I have the time.
